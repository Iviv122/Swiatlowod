# Small demo for animations 

Was made with Godot 4.5 (stable)

Initially thought was make a game with fully procedural animations. But sadly, it is too much work for single preson and troubleshooting for main character was already a major problem. It is not hard, but a very time consuming process. Anyway this repo contains small demo where you can test simple walking, shooting and looking around.

# Game controlls

- mouse to shoot
- WASD to move 

# Code base is burning dumpster
